Zendesk SAR Application for the Pause and Resume Functionality

## Installation and Use
This is a small utility for the [Amazon Connect app for Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/amazon-connect/?q=mkp_amazon) that enables accessing the Amazon Connect API from within the client app and thus controlling some aspects of Connect's functionality, such as pause and resume call recordings.
